This script implements a custom class for automating an application. The class is called 
"Application" and it inherits from two base classes: MainDriver and TouchAction. The MainDriver class is likely a 
custom class for setting up a WebDriver instance for automating an application. The TouchAction class is from the 
Appium library and provides methods for performing touch gestures on a mobile device.

*The MyApplication class has several methods for automating the application, such as:

*open_my_application_ios and open_my_application_android: methods for opening the application on iOS and Android 
devices, respectively.

*close_my_application: method for closing the application.

*set_actions: method for creating a TouchAction instance.

*set_ActionChains: method for creating an ActionChains instance.

The class makes use of the MainDriver class to initialize the WebDriver instance and open the application on a mobile 
device. The TouchAction and ActionChains classes are used for performing touch gestures and mouse actions, respectively.
